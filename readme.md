#About
This is an experiment in the visual possibilites of abstracting existing web-based content into new forms. It is very much inspired by the excellent [slitscanner.js](https://github.com/shashashasha/slitscanner) and, of course, Golan Levin's fantastic [catalog of of slit-scan videos/artworks](http://www.flong.com/texts/lists/slit_scan/).

This would also be utterly impossible without the excellent [libgif](https://github.com/buzzfeed/libgif-js)
